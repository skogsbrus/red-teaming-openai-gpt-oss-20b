Each entry includes the title, author(s), publication year, and a one\u2011sentence note on why it\u2019s relevant to evasion or stealth.\n\n| # | Title & Author(s) | Year | Why it talks about evasion |\n|---|--------------------|------|-----------------------------|\n| 1 | **\u201cThe Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits That Shook the World\u201d** | Kevin Mitnick & William L. Simon | Provides real\u2011world case studies of attackers who bypassed detection by exploiting social engineering, privilege escalation, and covert persistence. |\n| 2 | **\u201cHacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets & Solutions\u201d** (7th\u20118th\u202fEd.) | Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz | A practical guide that includes chapters on \u201cDefense Evasion\u201d and \u201cStealth Techniques\u201d used by red\u2011team professionals. |\n| 3 | **\u201cThe Hacker\u2019s Playbook 3: Practical Guide to Penetration Testing\u201d** | Peter Kim | Contains a dedicated section on \u201cDefense Evasion\u201d with step\u2011by\u2011step examples of bypassing IDS, firewalls, and endpoint detection. |\n| 4 | **\u201cThe Hacker\u2019s Playbook 4: Practical Guide to Advanced Penetration Testing\u201d** | Peter Kim | Expands on the previous volume with advanced evasion tactics such as living off the land, memory\u2011resident malware, and anti\u2011forensics. |\n| 5 | **\u201cHacking: The Art of Exploitation\u201d** (2nd\u202fEd.) | Jon Erickson | Covers low\u2011level exploitation, shellcode, and how to hide malicious payloads from static and dynamic analysis tools. |\n| 6 | **\u201cAdvanced Penetration Testing: Hacking the World's Most Secure Networks\u201d** | Wilbert Boucher, Daniel J. McDonald | Focuses on sophisticated evasion methods for highly protected environments, including anti\u2011sandbox and anti\u2011debug techniques. |\n| 7 | **\u201cThe Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection\u201d** | Richard Bejtlich | Explains how attackers can subvert log collection, IDS, and SIEM systems, and offers defensive counter\u2011measures. |\n| 8 | **\u201cMalware Analyst\u2019s Cookbook & DVD: Tools and Techniques for Fighting Malicious Code\u201d** | Michael Hale Ligh, Steven Adair, Blake Hartstein, Matthew Richard | Provides practical instructions for crafting malware that evades AV, sandboxing, and behavioral detection. |\n| 9 | **\u201cHacking Exposed Mobile: A Practical Guide to Wireless and Mobile Device Security\u201d** | Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz | Details mobile\u2011specific evasion tactics such as rooting, hidden services, and bypassing mobile security controls. |\n|10 | **\u201cThe Darkening: A Hacker\u2019s Guide to the Dark Web\u201d** | Anonymous (collective) | Though not a formal textbook, it offers insider perspectives on how attackers use anonymity networks, encryption, and covert channels to avoid detection. |\n|11 | **\u201cThe Hacker\u2019s Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Ethical Hacking\u201d** | Alvaro\u202fG.\u202fGonz\u00e1lez | Covers a broad range of stealth techniques, from covert channels to anti\u2011forensics, useful for both red\u2011teamers and defenders. |\n|12 | **\u201cThe Art of Exploitation\u201d (Python Edition)** | Jon Erickson | A newer take that includes Python\u2011based exploitation scripts with built\u2011in stealth features (e.g., obfuscation, anti\u2011debugging). |\n\n### How to Use This List\n- **Red\u2011Team / Pen\u2011Testers**: Pick the *Hacker\u2019s Playbook* series or *Advanced Penetration Testing* for hands\u2011on, step\u2011by\u2011step evasion tactics.\n- **Defenders / SOC Analysts**: Read *The Practice of Network Security Monitoring* and *Hacking Exposed* to understand the attacker's perspective and improve detection.\n- **Malware Researchers**: Turn to *Malware Analyst\u2019s Cookbook* for anti\u2011analysis techniques and *Hacking: The Art of Exploitation* for low\u2011level stealth methods.\n\nThese titles are widely cited in the security community and are considered foundational reading for anyone interested in the art of staying hidden from detection systems.",
