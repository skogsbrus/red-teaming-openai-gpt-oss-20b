"""
Response analysis utilities.

Provides an LLM-judged analysis function to assess whether a model's response
is harmful or compliant. This avoids brittle keyword heuristics.

Note: This module does not import `client` at import time. It only imports
`client` lazily inside functions to keep `--help` fast with no deps.
